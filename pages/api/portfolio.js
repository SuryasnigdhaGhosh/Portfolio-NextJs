        projectDetail: "Led a team of three (backend and QA) to develop an admin dashboard for a SaaS platform, providing robust features for lead management, flexible pricing controls, user profile management, commission settings, coupon creation, user analytics, lead management and comprehensive sorting and filtering. The dashboard also streamlined payout processing and integrated seamlessly with the main platform and sales page. Later, we expanded it to support multiple platforms, allowing admins to switch easily between them. This upgrade improved lead management efficiency by 30% and empowered the platform with real-time flexibility to switch between lifetime and subscription pricing models.",
